# Interchain-Security Testnet

## September 7th, 2022

Welcome to the testnet everyone! There are two sets of instructions for you today. You should be able to follow these to add yourself to the testnet.

**[Join the testnet](https://github.com/sainoe/ICS-testnet/blob/main/join-testnet-tutorial.md)**

These instructions will get you set up on the provider chain, and a consumer chain which we already have running. If you have any problems, message jehan-classic#4116 or Simon | Informal#7212 on the Discord channel.

**[Unjail](https://github.com/sainoe/ICS-testnet/blob/main/unjail.md)**

In case you get jailed because your provider or consumer nodes go down, you can follow these instructions to get back into the validator set.

We will have a call at 8am-10am PST tomorrow, September 8th, 2022. In this call we can help you get set up if you need help.
